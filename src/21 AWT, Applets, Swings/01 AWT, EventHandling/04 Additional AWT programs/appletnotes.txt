The restrictions are:
- Applet cannot Read/Write on to client disk.
- Applet cannot access the client resources like .jpg, .gif or audio/video files etc. It has to bring req. resources with itself.
- Cannot read & send back the IP-Address of the client. Can access only the IP Addr. of the server from which it is instantiated.
- It cannot communicate to any other server except for it's server from which it is instantiated.
The Applet is executed by a JIT interpretor (Just Intime Translator) available in browser. The execution of applet begins from 
     public void init() method. 
Applet superclass provides no GUI to the program but provide the applet life-cycle methods. The methods are:
1. p v init(): It is the initialization method. Executes only once when applet is loaded. Used for setting up resources required for applet execution.
2. p v start(): It is executed many times. It is used to startup resources that are required during app. runtime.Ex: Threads. start() executes whenever applet comes into view. For example:
  - when applet screen is restored after      minimizing.
 - when user goes to another page and       returns back to the page.

3. p v paint(Graphics var): It is one of the life-cycle methods of applet but is not from Applet superclass. paint() is provided by Container class. It draws the graphical information on applet. The Graphics class provides information like x-axis,y-axis etc to applet methods. Executes many times.
- When applet is resized.
- When applet is restored.
- When applet receives focus.
- When applet is uncovered by    another window.
4. p v stop(): used for stopping resources that are not required when applet is not in view. Executes many times. 
- When applet window is minimized.
- When user moves to another page     thru link.
5. p v destroy(): executes only once when applet is closed. Used to release resources that were initialized at init() method.
